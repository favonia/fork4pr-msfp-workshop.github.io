<h1>All your base categories are belong to us: A syntactic model of presheaves in type theory</h1>
<b>Pierre-Marie P&#x00e9;drot</b> (<i>Inria Rennes-Bretagne-Atlantique, France</i>)

<p>Presheaves are a staple categorical structure, which naturally arises
in a wide variety of situations. In the realm of logic, they are often
used as a model factory. Indeed, presheaves over some base category
will result in a topos, whose contents can be fine-tuned by carefully
picking the base category. As computer scientists, though, we have
learnt that there are even better logical systems than toposes:
dependent type theories! Through the Curry-Howard mirror, they are
also full-blown functional programming languages that actually
compute.</p>

<p>This begs the following question: is it possible to build the
type-theoretic equivalent of presheaves, while retaining the good
computational properties of our dependent programming languages? We
will see that strikingly enough, presheaves can already be presented
as computational objects to some extent, except for the annoying fact
that they do not obey the right conversion rules! A proper account of
type-theoretic presheaves will require a coming-of-age journey through
the world of effectful program semantics, using fine and modern tools
such as call-by-push-value, dependent parametricity and strict
equality. In the end, we will formulate an alternative presentation of
presheaves in type theory, but which is still equivalent to its
standard categorical counterpart when viewed from the static world of
sets. As an application, we will use them to extend dependent type
theory with new effective logical principles.</p>
