<h1>Ninth Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming (MSFP 2022)</h1>

<p><em>Functionality from Structure</em></p>

<!-- <h3><em>Registration deadline: Tuesday 25th August</em></h3> -->


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The ninth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without arrows?  Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes
on. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to reflect
mathematical phenomena in data and control.</p>

<p>MSFP 2022 will be held on Saturday 2nd April 2022 in affiliation with <a href="https://etaps.org/2022">ETAPS 2022</a> in Munich, Germany.</p>

</p>

<p>We accept two categories of submission: full papers of no more than
15 pages that will appear in the proceedings, and extended abstracts
of no more than 2 pages which we will post on the website, but which
do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the
proceedings. References and appendices are not included in page
limits. Appendices may not be read by reviewers. </p>
<p>Full papers (not two page talk abstracts) must report previously
unpublished work and not be submitted concurrently to another
conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted papers and talks must
be presented at the workshop by at least one of the authors.</p>
<p>The proceedings will be published under the auspices of
<a href="http://eptcs.org/">EPTCS</a> with a Creative Commons license. Papers
must be prepared in LaTeX using the <a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">EPTCS macro
package</a>.</p>
